   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the API.

## Usage

The sentiment analysis service can be accessed via the API. Here are some examples of how to use it:

### Analyzing Sentiment

To analyze sentiment, send a POST request to the `/analyze` endpoint with the text data.

**Example Request**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "I love programming!"}'
```

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "score": 0.95
}
```

### Viewing Analysis History

You can view past analyses by accessing the `/history` endpoint. This will return a list of previous analyses.

**Example Request**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/history
```

**Example Response**:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "text": "I love programming!",
    "sentiment": "positive",
    "score": 0.95
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "text": "I hate bugs.",
    "sentiment": "negative",
    "score": 0.85
  }
]
```

## API Documentation

The API is built using FastAPI, which automatically generates documentation. You can access the interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Endpoints

- **POST /analyze**: Analyze the sentiment of a given text.
- **GET /history**: Retrieve the history of analyzed texts.
